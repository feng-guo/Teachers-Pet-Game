# Math
Generally regarded as the most noble of all studies, math is a fundamental aspect of the universe, learning, and Chinese students of RHHS. Comparatively speaking, the mathematics department at RHHS is very competent, hosting a wide variety of challenging programs and playing host to top math students in the country. Despite this, math is regarded as one of the most dreaded subject areas of RHHS. The sheer intensity and competition between students fuels many sleepless nights either cramming for a test or regretting the existence of life itself after an assessment. Math is strong against English and weak against Science.

# Moves

**Description**: Prove that 2n^6-n^4-n^2 is divisible by 36.
* Base power: 85
* Accuracy: 100%
* PP: 8

### Olympiads Question
Olympiads school is an absolute prison for all those unfortunate enough to enroll in one of their courses.

Olympiads is notorious for delivering questions that can only be comprehended if the student spoke Chinese.

**Description**: Sorry I don't understand Mandarin.

**Effect**
* Base power: 60
* Accuracy: 95%

**Effect**
* Base power: 95
* Accuracy: 95%
* PP: 10

# Science
Science is a vital aspect that is used to explain natural phenomenons when people do not believe in religion. Present since humans started thinking, science is now used to explain why we fall when we jump, what the world is composed of and how we are sentient. RHHS science has gained an interesting reputation, backed by its enthusiastically eccentric staff. Most students endure TLAP, dangerous labs, and dissections that churn the insides of any student.

# Moves
## Attack moves
### Electrocute Paperclip 
Sticking a paperclip in a socket is never a good idea. The high voltage from an active outlet is more than enough to kill someone that is not thinking properly. They become stunned and can go into cardiac arrests as their sinoatrial node functions improperly.

**Effect**
* Base power: 80
* Accuracy: 100%
* PP: 10

**Effect**
* Base power: 40
* Accuracy: 100%
* PP: 15

## Status
### Dissect Frog
Dissections are an important aspect of biology and learning internal systems of organisms. However, because of the fact that the organisms have been preserved in a nasty liquid, it will make anyone sick. It smells gross, looks gross, and makes you feel gross. There is no point in taking biology because you learn everything you need to know about biology in computer science courses anyway.

**Description**: Where is the duodenum in a fish I regret taking this course.

**Effect**
* Poisons the opponent
* Accuracy: 90%
* PP: 15

## Intelligence
### Titration
Titration, in theory, is mixing two solutions and having some equations next to each other and multiplying some random numbers together until you get a correct answer. You kinda just play around with an expensive piece of glass, and hope that you don't overshoot the titrant. Usually, you should be working with dilute solutions but if you are dumb, 18M HCl isn't that bad.

**Description**: Crap I used the wrong significant figures in my calculations and now my numbers are all wrong.

**Effect**
* Base power: 70
* PP: 15

**Effect**
* Doubles the speed of the user
* PP: 8

## Intelligence
### Deoptimize Code
When you try to make a program, it's common sense to seek out help if you don't completely understand what you're doing. Usually, it's best to look at someone else's code to understand the situation. When you copy the code in your own style, you end up creating garbage. Realizing that you have something better to do than make a car find a gas station in Java, you just steal code but alter it a little bit.

**Description**: Running inefficient stolen code is okay if your professor does not care about how fast your program is.

**Effect**
* Base power: 50
* Accuracy: 100%
* PP: 10

### Stack Overflow
Stack Overflow is the website, along with Google, that has been able to keep programmers employed for decades. Stack Overflow originates from the the term "Stack buffer overflow", which occurs when a program writes to memory on a call stack outside the intended data structure. This error usually occurs when a recursive program does not terminate.

**Description**: Stack Overflow is the only website you need to land yourself a programming job. Frustrates teachers.

**Effect**
* Base power 30
* Accuracy: 100%
* PP: 20

### Steal Code
When you need help with an algorithm, it would make the most sense to ask for help. However, in the quest to attend the best schools, students find themselves on a crunch for time. Therefore, it is imperative to beg their friends for their code to "look" at it. In the end, the student knows that they're going to end up stealing the methods to navigate the city.

**Description**: Programming is hard. Stealing? Not so much.

**Effect**
* Base power: 40
* Accuracy: 95%
* PP: 15

# Neutral
Neutral moves do not belong in either science, math, English, or Technology. If a person is neutral, it is because they specialize in something non-STEM (Science, Technology, English, Math, and we are aware that E is not supposed to correspond to English) and therefore irrelevant. Moves that are neutral are either physical or also non-STEM.
