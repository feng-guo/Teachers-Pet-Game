## Speed Boost
**Description**:
When you do something over and over again, you naturally become better at it. You become more familiar with the concepts of the task at hand, allowing you to increase the speed at which you do the task. That and you might just get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

**Effect**:
Every turn, the speed of the person is doubled.

## Unaware
**Description**:
You're a brilliant student. You have good marks and everyone is jealous of you. Except for that one class you always seem to be failing in no matter what you do. You're pretty sure the teacher thinks you're weak, stupid, and slow. Maybe.

**Effect**:
The character with this ability ignores stat changes of their opponent, beneficial or not.
